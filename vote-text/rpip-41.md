# RPIP-41: Committee Stipends

RPIP-41 establishes stipends for members of pDAO committees.

* The global hourly stipend rate is decided by the pDAO and applies to all committees. The initial stipend rate is set at 30 USD / hr.
* Committees receive a stipend total of `members * expected hours * global rate`.
* Committees may split their stipend total amongst their members in any manner they choose.
* Stipend payouts are managed by the Grants Management Committee (GMC) and paid from the GMC's budget.
* Total cost of initial committee stipends is 7020 USD / month. 

## Outcome If Vote Passes

RPIP-41 will be ratified by the pDAO, empowering the GMC to pay stipends to members of pDAO committees. At the time of this vote, the only pDAO committees within Rocket Pool are the [Grants Management Committee](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-40) and the [Incentive Management Committee](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-20).

## Rationale

Committee members fill important roles within the Rocket Pool DAO. On a moral level, they deserve to be rewarded for the time and value they are providing to the DAO. On a more practical level, previous committee elections have struggled to find sufficient nominees to both:
* Offer meaningful choice to the pDAO.
* Provide a sufficient number of substitute members if a committee member is no longer able to volunteer their time. 

A stipend may help to increase the attractiveness of the membership roles and will reward committee members for the value they provide to the Rocket Pool DAO.
