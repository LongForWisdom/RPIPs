# RPIP-39 Bounty Incentives

RPIP-39 proposes to allow the Grants Management Committee to pay out incentives to community members engaging with the bounty system.

* Incentives are limited to 10% of the total bounty reward amount.
* A consistent allocation method for bounty incentives is left to the GMC to determine and announce.
* These incentives are paid out of the GMC's budget.
* The pDAO may challenge individual payouts and changes to the incentive allocation method using the existing committee decision challenge system.

## Outcome If Vote Passes

RPIP-39 will be ratified by the pDAO, empowering the GMC to spend up to 10% of a given bounty payout value on incentives connected to that bounty. 

## Rationale

Bounties provide a good middle ground between retroactive payment applications and grant applications in terms of the risk balance between the DAO and the service provider. However, bounty proposals require more effort from the community to be successful in their goal. This includes both up-front efforts to make an effective proposal, and ongoing efforts to support bounty hunters that lack deep knowledge of Rocket Pool. The existing bounty framework does not recognize this effort, and the GMC is not explicitly empowered to recognize it absent pDAO input. 

In practice, this change allows the GMC to incentivize any or all of the following:
* A higher quantity of bounty proposals.
* A higher quality of bounty proposals.
* Effective support for bounty hunters lacking some Rocket Pool knowledge. 

If used, these incentives may result in a more effective, consistent, and populous bounty program.
