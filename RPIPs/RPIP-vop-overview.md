## Abstract

## Motivation

## Specification
This RPIP shall be maintained by the RPIP Editors such that it includes an entry for every Voted Operational Process present in the Rocket Pool DAOs. 

This is an informational RPIP. Information in the Overview descriptions is descriptive rather than binding.

## Grants Management Committee Processes

### VOP-GMC-MEMBERSELECT
**Defined In:** [RPIP-26](RPIP-26.md)  
**Voting Group:** pDAO  

Used to select the membership of the Grants Management Committee. The members are first nominated, and then elected via a pDAO vote. Selection takes place at least once a year. It may occur more frequently if required due to lack of valid members on the committee.

### VOP-GMC-DISPUTE
**Defined In:** [RPIP-26](RPIP-26.md)  
**Voting Group:** pDAO  

Used by the Rocket Pool community to dispute a grants decision made by the Grants Management Committee. A dispute can be raised within two weeks of a decision, and will go to a pDAO vote which may direct the GMC to reverse the decision.

### VOP-GMC-ADMINSELECT
**Defined In:** [RPIP-26](RPIP-26.md)  
**Voting Group:** GMC Members  

Used to select the Grants Management Committee Administrator. The administrator is chosen via an internal vote by the GMC members after seeking public applications. The administrator helps organize and manage the GMC members in their duties. 

### VOP-GMC-ADMINREMOVE
**Defined In:** [RPIP-26](RPIP-26.md)  
**Voting Group:** GMC Members  

Used to remove the Grants Management Committee Administrator. GMC members can remove the GMC administrator via an internal vote if for whatever reason the administrator is no longer deemed a suitable fit for the position.

## Incentives Management Committee Processes

### VOP-IMC-MEMBERSELECT
**Defined In:** [RPIP-20](RPIP-20.md)  
**Voting Group:** pDAO  


Used to select the membership of the Incentives Management Committee. The members are first nominated, and then elected via a pDAO vote. Selection takes place at least once a year, though more frequently if required due to lack of valid members to fill the committee.

## oDAO Membership Processes

### VOP-ODAO-MEMBERSUGGEST
**Defined In:** [RPIP-24](RPIP-24.md)  
**Voting Group:** pDAO  

Used by the pDAO to signal a desired change for membership in the oDAO. The pDAO does not have the ability to force the oDAO to change its membership, but may suggest a change via this VOP. 

### VOP-ODAO-MEMBERCHANGE
**Defined In:** [RPIP-24](RPIP-24.md)  
**Voting Group:** oDAO  

Used by the oDAO to add or remove its members. Voting takes place on-chain by existing oDAO members. The oDAO is required to vote on a member change if the pDAO suggest one via VOP-ODAO-MEMBERSUGGEST.
